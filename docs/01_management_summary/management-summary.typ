// Management summary 
  /*Even though this is the first chapter of your document, it is typically the last one filled with content. The *Management Summary* is a *brief and high-level summary* of your project. It should give any reader unfamiliar to the project an overview of the contents included later in the document.
    
    
  A common structure is:
  
    - What is the problem we wanted to solve?
    - How did we solve the problem?
    - Does your solution solve the problem in a successful way?
    - Will there be consecutive projects based on your work?
  
  Diagrams and images work very well in this chapter, especially screenshots of your software.
  
  
  One final remark: a well written management summary is a good starting point for your {Project Presentation}, as you will address a similar audience there.*/
