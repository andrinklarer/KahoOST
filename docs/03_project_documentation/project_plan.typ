= Project Plan
    Describe the project plan as covered in the SEP2 module. A project plan typically consists of the following topics:
        - Processes, meetings and roles
        - Phases, iterations and milestones
        - A *rough* list of things to be done (work items)
        - Risk management
        - Planning Tools (issue tracker, time tracker, ...)
    
    You should *_not_* describe your *technical solution* in this chapter. It is all about organizing your project.
