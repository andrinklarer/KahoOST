= Time Tracking Report
     The main goal of this chapter is to show your stakeholders that your project is on track, i.e. you will be able to finish it within the remaining time. The chapter should cover two topics:
        - Describe *how you track time* in your project. Try to avoid duplication with the *Project Plan*.
        - The *current time tracking statistics* for your project.
    
    For the latter one, keep the information on a high-level:
        - How much time did we invest in total yet? How much is remaining?
        - How much time did we invest in iteration 1, 2, 3, ...?
        - How much time did we invest in which topic?
    
    Diagrams work very well to communicate these information. Low-level information (e.g. *{how much time did we spend on task XYZ?*) is best kept within the chosen time tracking tool.
