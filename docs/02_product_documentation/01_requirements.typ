= Requirements
    Describe the functional and non-functional requirements as covered in the SEP1 module.

== Functional Requirements
    The functional requirements should contain at least:
        - The actors of the system under development (SUD).
        - The goals of each actor.
        - A use case digram that provides a good overview of the actors, use cases, and the relationships between them.
        - Use case descriptions in the brief, casual, or fully-dressed format (depending on the level of detail required at the current phase of the project) for the SUD.
        - Tip: Use identifiers such as `UC1', `UC2', \ldots as references for your use cases.

== Non-Functional Requirements
    - Choose an appropriate form (bare minimum, ISO/IEC 25010:2011, FURPS, \ldots ) for your non-functional requirements (NFRs) as covered in SEP1.
    - Try to concentrate on the NFRs that are most relevant or special to the SUD.
    - Make sure that your NFRs are verifiable (acceptance criteria).
    - Document how and when you plan to verify your stated NFRs.
    - TIP: Use identifiers such as `NFR1', `NFR2', \ldots as references for your NFRs.
