= Quality Measures

== Working Environment
    /*Describe the quality measures applied in your project as covered in the SEP1 and SEP2 modules. Things that might be included in this chapter:
        - Organizational means like *Merge Requests*, *Definition of Done*, etc.
        - Guidelines for code, documentation, version control, etc.
        - Tools used to assess the quality of your product (linter, metrics, ...)
        - Tools used to build and deploy your product (CI/CD)
    
    Try to avoid duplication with other chapters such as the *Project Plan*. Work with cross-references when appropriate.*/

== Testing
	/*Describe the *Test Strategy* used for testing your product as discussed in the SEP1 module. How each functional and non-functional requirement is verified, at what level (Unit, Integration, System), etc.*/
