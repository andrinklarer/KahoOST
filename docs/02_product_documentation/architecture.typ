= Architecture
    /*Describe the architecture of your software as covered in the SEP2 module. The main goal of this chapter is describing the \textbf{technical implementation} in a way that a new team member can start working on the product as fast as possible.
        - Use an existing template as a starting point (\texttt{arc42}, \texttt{C4 model}, ...)
        - Focus on stable, high-level concepts rather than details
        - Cover different views (static, dynamic, deployment, ...)
        - Prefer diagrams over text (ideally UML)
        - Explain the reasons behind your actions: \textit{Why did we build it like this?}*/
