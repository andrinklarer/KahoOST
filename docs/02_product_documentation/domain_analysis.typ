= Domain Analysis
    /*Describe the problem domain using a domain model as covered in the SEP1 module. The domain model should contain at least:
        - A domain model diagram that describes the problem domain at an appropriate level of abstraction.
        - A description of aspects of the problem domain that are important, non-standard, or are difficult to understand form the domain model alone.*/
